<h2> Our Festival </h2>


<p>Folk Week is an annual week-long folk festival held in Broadstairs, a seaside town in the county of Kent, that celebrates folk culture. Folk week was founded by Jack Hamilton in the mid 60's and would take place twice a day in Pierremont Park. It consisted of folk performers from all over the country and abroad coming to Broadstairs to take part in the celebrations.</p>

<p>Since its inception, the festival has experienced significant grown in popularity. The event now attracts not only folk fans from all over but also the residents of Broadstairs and neighbouring towns, who wholeheartedly embrace the folk spirit and actively participate throughout the week, further enhancing the already wonderful atmosphere.</p>
